# Milestone 2: the pilot on the laptop-server

## 2026-10-10 — Started without a NOW.md, on the owner's decision

- **Request** (owner, verbatim): "Milestone 2, the pilot on the laptop-server: the app runs as a service behind the Cloudflare Tunnel at a visiometrica.com address, with HTTPS and a fresh database (not ~/superassistant-data)"; "generally we will mirror the CourseBench configuratio routine".
- **Plan:** none. Owner, verbatim: "do we really need a now file; just guide me through necessary steps to achieve the goals of this milestone". `NOW.md` stays milestone 1's frozen `65d0ad16…`.
- **Scope:** what Opus 5.5 showed the owner as REQUIRED NOW on 10 October:
  - the visitor's address behind the tunnel;
  - a sending mode;
  - host commands reading the settings file;
  - hosted start refusals, `/healthz`, a mail test and a startup line;
  - the reminder timer;
  - the deployment files.
  It also includes Codex's migration race, which the timer's second process makes live.
- **Owner decisions** (verbatim answers):
  - address "use the nbu-superassistant";
  - code folder "apps/nbu-superassistant";
  - records "Yes, ~/nbu-superassistant-data (Recommended)";
  - service "Rename to "nbu-superassistant"" (`1b3e254`);
  - sender "Yes, nbu-superassistant@visiometrica.com (Recommended)";
  - mail "Real recipients from day one", whose option limited the pilot, until 8.7, to "invented students, testers who agreed";
  - reminders "Daily at 09:00, calendar days (Recommended)";
  - the Resend key CourseBench uses.
- **Review:** Opus 5.5 implements; Codex reviews the code (`CLAUDE_1.md`).
- **DEFERRED** (Opus 5.5's proposal; the owner did not comment):
  - limits on staff sign-in;
  - the typed-supervisor message;
  - DMARC;
  - a paid Resend plan.
